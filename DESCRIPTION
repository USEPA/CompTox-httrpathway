Description: This package generates pathway (signature) scores with associated concentration response
  modeling; it also contains some important plotting functions. This package contains functions 
  required to create input files (log2-fold change, or (l2fc) matrices) and run the signature/pathway
  based concentration-response calculations. Another R project (httranalysis) contains a series of post-calculation
  analyses that are problem-specific. To run all of the calculations, use the function driver().
  This version has also included gene-level concentration-response modeling
  This package required a set of directories to be at the same level as the httrpathway folder
  ../input - various input files
  ../input/chemicals - collections of chemical information, not used in the standard calculations
  ../input/signatures - the signature data, inluding the catalog (an Excel file) and the lists of genes per signature
  ../input/fcdata - where the l2fc data goes. See the functions buildFCMAT1 and buildFCMAT2 for
  more information. These functions may need to be customizedfor the source of your data 
  ../output - where all of the output goes [not clear if the subfolders are created on demand]
