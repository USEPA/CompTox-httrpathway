Description: This package generates pathway (signature) scores with associated concentration response
  modeling; it also contains some important plotting functions. This package contains functions 
  required to create input files (log2-fold change, or (l2fc) matrices) and run the signature/pathway
  based concentration-response calculations. Another R project (httranalysis) contains a series of post-calculation
  analyses that are problem-specific. To run all of the calculations, use the function driver().
  This version has also included gene-level concentration-response modeling
  This package required a set of directories to be at the same level as the httrpathway folder
  ../input - various input files
  ../input/chemicals - collections of chemical information, not used in the standard calculations
  ../input/signatures - the signature data, inluding the catalog (an Excel file) and the lists of genes per signature
  ../input/fcdata - where the l2fc data goes. See the functions buildFCMAT1 and buildFCMAT2 for
  more information. These functions may need to be customizedfor the source of your data 
  ../output - where all of the output goes [not clear if the subfolders are created on demand]
  There are a series of data sets / objects that are names and carried around
  * dataset - this is the name of the data set being used. It corresponds to an experiment and the name
    ususally contains hte cell type, the type of normalization, the time, media, etc. All input and output files 
    will contain this dataset name
  * sigcatalog - THis is the name of the signature catalog. THis is an excel file taht lives in ../input/signatures.
    This file contains one row persignature and contains matching annotations such as the super_target
  * sigset - One always uses a subset of the total set of signtures, indicated by haveing a value of 1 in
    the sigset column at the right hand of the signature catalog
