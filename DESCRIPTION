Description: This package generates pathway scores with associated concentration response
  modeling; it also contains some important plotting functions. "pathwayScore" uses 
  chemical/concentration by gene matrices of log2(fold change) values and pathway
  definitions to generate chemical/concentration by pathway matrices of pathway score 
  values. Three pathway methods are included: "fc" (fold change in pathway - fold change 
  outside pathway), "mygsea" (modified ssGSEA), and "gsva". "pathwayConcResp_pval" 
  generates concentration response fits, related statistics, and plots for the pathway 
  scores, given pathway scores run on null data (which itself can be generated by 
  "randomdata"). "runAllPathwayCR" wraps the main functions. "pathwayAccumNullPlot" 
  generates BMD accumulation plots. "referenceAC50" checks the accuracy of a given 
  pathway given ER reference data. "runAllRepChemPidCR", "runAllRepChemCR", 
  "repChemPidPlot" and "repChemPathwayPlot" generate results for the replication study.
