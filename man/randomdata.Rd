\usage{
randomdata(
  basedir = "../input/fcdata/",
  dataset = "DMEM_6hr_pilot_normal_pe_1",
  nchem = 10,
  seed = 12345
)
}
\arguments{
\item{basedir}{Directory that holds FCMAT2 and CHEM_DICT files.}

\item{dataset}{Name of actual dataset to base null data on.}

\item{nchem}{Number of null chemicals. Number of null samples is approximately
eight times this value.}

\item{seed}{Random seed.}
}
\value{
No output.
}
\description{
Generate randomized null data based on actual data.
}
\details{
New FCMAT2 and CHEM_DICT files corresponding to the null dataset are written
to disk in the basedir folder. The nullset name is paste0(dataset, "_", nchem).
Randomization is performed by sampling the quantile function for each gene in
the actual data. The nullset will have roughly the same distribution of values
for each gene in the actual data,
