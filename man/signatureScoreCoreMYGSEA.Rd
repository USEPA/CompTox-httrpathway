\arguments{
\item{sk.list}{Sample keys to use; should correspond to fcmat rownames.}

\item{method}{Method name to use in file output. "mygsea" or "mygsea_norank"}

\item{sigset}{Name of signature set.}

\item{dataset}{Name of data set.}

\item{fcmat}{Sample by gene matrix of log2(fold change)'s. Rownames are
sample keys and colnames are genes.}

\item{chem_dict}{Dataframe with one row per sample key and seven columns:
sample_key, sample_id, conc, time, casrn, name, dtxsid.}

\item{signature_data}{Named ist of gene name vectors. Each element is one
signature, defined by the genes it contains.}

\item{mc.cores}{Number of cores to use. Parallelization is performed
by gsva itself.}

\item{normalization}{normalization = T normalizes final scores.}

\item{useranks}{useranks = T uses score ranks for weighting; otherwise,
fold changes are used for weights.}

No output.

\description{
Computes signature scores for mygsea.
}
\details{
This function is a parallelized wrapper for MYGSEA, which does the actual
scoring. mygsea method uses ranks and normalization, while mygsea_norank
method does not use ranks or normalization. Normalization divides final
scores by difference between max and min score. Without normalization,
scores from individual samples have no impact on each other. Final
signaturescoremat is written to disk.
